# Java bytecode

## Exercise

### Compile to Bytecode

    javac SimpleCalculator.java

This will create a new file called SimpleCalculator.class

### Analyse Bytecode

    javap -c SimpleCalculator

See how the Bytecode works!

Questions:
* Is the Java bytecode already optimised by JIT?
* Is the bytecode statically or dynamically typed?
