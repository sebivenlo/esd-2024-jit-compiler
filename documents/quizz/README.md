# JIT, Compiler, and Interpreter Quiz

This quiz is designed to test students' knowledge on three important topics in computer science: **Interpreter**, **Compiler**, and **Just-In-Time (JIT) Compiler**. It will assess the understanding of how these tools work, their advantages, disadvantages, and their use cases in programming environments.

## Quiz Structure

The quiz is divided into three sections, each focusing on a specific topic:

1. **Interpreter**  
   This section will include questions that evaluate the student's understanding of how interpreters function, their key features, and the programming languages that commonly use interpreters.

2. **Compiler**  
   This section will cover questions related to the process of compilation, the differences between compilers and interpreters, and the advantages and limitations of using compilers.

3. **JIT Compiler**  
   The final section focuses on Just-In-Time compilers, their role in improving execution performance at runtime, and specific use cases where JIT compilers are especially beneficial.

Each section consists of multiple-choice questions (MCQs), aimed at checking the student's comprehension and application of these concepts.
