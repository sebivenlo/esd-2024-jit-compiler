### Audience knowledge (25 minute)
#### Rules: 
- no laptops/phones. 
- Facilitator only asks questions(no more than 4 minutes otherwise after the workshop), and does not give answers. 
- Facilitator write input from audience on whiteboard. 


- What is a compiler?
  - Does Java has a compiler? How does that work? Ask audience what they remember from PCR1/PCR2.
  - What is inlining?
  - what is the interpreter?
  - what is the difference between those two?
- Landscape languages
  - Does Python has a compiler? How does that work?
  - Does C has a compiler? think about the OSCO module.
- Do all languages have a compiler?

- What is a JIT compiler?
- What does 'just' in JIT mean? 
- For what languages a JIT compiler would be interested?
- Why there exist interpreted languages?
- Why is the warming up happening

### Presentation (15 minutes)
- What is a compiler/interpreter?
- How does a compiler/interpreter work?
- What is JIT compiler?
- What are the pros and cons of using jit compiler?
- What are use cases for JIT compiler?
- Future for JIT compiler?
- Questions (4 minutes)

### Break (15 minutes)

### Hands-on (25 minutes)
For content see [README](../README.md)

### Group discussion (10 minutes)

- Quizz - incognito, questions about difference of compilers. Questions about the interpreter and compiler 10 minutes

- QUIzz: compiler, interpreter, JIT, use cases: evaluation of student's knowledge 

Show problem that python and c are more generic in parameters, which means that some programming languagues are more strict in type parameters

show a problem where the jit compiler can run the program easily and with a normal compiler it doesnt work

What type of code are prefered for the jit compiler
