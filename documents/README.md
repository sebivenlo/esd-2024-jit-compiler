## Planning for the Workshop and Research

### JIT Compiler Workshop

#### 1. Introduction to JIT Compilation (5-10 mins)

##### What is a JIT Compiler?

Just-in-time compilation is a method for improving the performance of interpreted programs. During execution the program may be compiled into native code to improve its performance. It is also known as dynamic compilation.

Traditionally there are two methods for converting source code into a form that can be run on a platform. Static compilation converts the code into a language for a specific platform. An interpreter directly executes the source code. To get more into details about how JIT compiler works we have to know the two normal coverters of source code(compiler and interpreter)

![Alt text](/documents/images/compiler_vs_interpreter.webp)


Compiler: A compiler that supports the source programming language reads the files, analyzes the code, and translates it into a format suitable for the target platform. Compilers that translate source code to machine code target specific operating systems and computer architectures. For example in Java, the process of compilation will look like the image below.

![Alt text](/documents/images/java_compilation_process.png)

Interpreter: An interpreter is a computer program that is used to directly execute program instructions written using one of the many high-level programming languages.

The interpreter transforms the high-level program into an intermediate language that it then executes, or it could parse the high-level source code and then performs the commands directly, which is done line by line or statement by statement.

![Alt text](/documents/images/interpreter_process.png)

To summary the pros and const of both methods, we made a table. See below



| Aspect            | Compiler                                                   | Interpreter                                                  |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Execution Speed**| Faster execution after compilation, as the entire code is translated into machine language before execution. | Slower, as the code is translated and executed line-by-line.  |
| **Error Detection**| Errors are detected only after the entire program is compiled, which can make debugging harder. | Errors are detected immediately during execution, making debugging easier. |
| **Translation**    | Translates the entire source code into machine code at once, generating a separate executable file. | Translates and executes code line-by-line without generating a separate file. |
| **Memory Usage**   | Requires more memory upfront for compilation and storage of the executable file. | Generally uses less memory since thereâ€™s no need for storing an entire executable. |
| **Development Cycle** | Slower development cycle as the entire program must be recompiled after each change. | Faster development cycle as changes can be tested immediately without recompilation. |
| **Portability**    | Executable files are platform-dependent and may not run on different systems without recompilation. | Source code is platform-independent, as long as the interpreter is available on the platform. |
| **Optimization**   | Allows for advanced optimizations during the compilation process, improving runtime performance. | Limited optimization as code is interpreted and executed immediately. |
| **Use Cases**      | Ideal for production environments where performance is critical (e.g., C, C++). | Ideal for scripting, development, or education where quick feedback is needed (e.g., Python, JavaScript). |
| **Initial Overhead**| High, due to the time required for full compilation before execution. | Low, as execution begins immediately after interpretation. |
| **Runtime Changes** | Not suitable for interactive or dynamic runtime changes since code needs to be recompiled. | Suitable for interactive and dynamic runtime changes (e.g., REPL environments). |

Now going back to what JIT compiler is. JIT compilation attempts to use the benefits of both. While the interpreted program is being run, the JIT compiler determines the most frequently used code and compiles it to machine code. Depending on the compiler, this can be done on a method or smaller section of code.

##### Difference between JIT and AOT Compilation:

- **JIT**: Code is compiled at runtime (e.g., Java, .NET CLR).
- **AOT**: Code is compiled before execution (e.g., C, C++).

##### Overview of Key Concepts:

- Explain bytecode, machine code, and interpreters, showing how JIT fits in.

#### 2. what is JIT compiler and How a it Works (10-15 mins)

##### Phases of JIT Compilation:

- **Interpretation phase**: Code is initially run by an interpreter.
- **Profiling phase**: The JIT monitors the performance of the code during execution.
- **Hot code detection**: The most frequently executed parts (hotspots) are compiled to machine code.
- **Machine code generation**: Hot code is compiled and executed natively.

##### Advantages of JIT:

- **Optimization at runtime**: Adaptations to the hardware or input-specific optimizations.
- **Faster execution for hot code**: Native code is faster than interpreted bytecode.

##### Challenges:

- **Initial delay (warm-up time)** while the JIT compiles code.
- **Memory overhead** due to storing both bytecode and machine code.

#### 3. JIT Compiler Optimization Techniques (10-15 mins)

##### Hotspot Optimization:

- Detecting frequently executed code segments (methods or loops).

##### Inlining:

- Avoiding function calls by replacing them with the function body.

##### Dead Code Elimination:

- Removing code that never gets executed.

##### Register Allocation and Optimization:

- Efficiently using CPU registers to avoid memory access.

##### Adaptive Optimization:

- The JIT can recompile code multiple times to improve performance based on runtime data.
