# Project Workshop ESD Approach

This repository is part of the ESD (Enterprise Software Development) module, where students investigate various architectural aspects, technologies, frameworks, or business technologies with architectural implications. The aim is to analyze and present these topics—highlighting both their strengths and weaknesses—in a workshop setting attended by the rest of the class.

### Project/workshop Description

This project focuses on exploring the Just-In-Time (JIT) Compiler, a powerful optimization technique used in modern programming languages to achieve a balance between interpretation and compilation.

#### Why we choose this topic?
We chose to focus on the JIT compiler because of its ability to compile and interpret code simultaneously. This hybrid approach allows for more flexible, which results in performance improvements.

## Audience

Our audience consist of 4th year Informatics students. There will be around 30 students and 2 teachers. Students learned Java in PRC1/PRC2/ALDA. Learned C programming in OSCO. And in projects learned about Javascript/TypeScript. In Data Science, and maybe internship/minor learned about Python. In PRC1 or PRC2, students learned about the Java Architecture, like the JVM.

## Workshop
Training workshops are designed to teach new skills or knowledge to attendees. The goal of a training workshop is to provide attendees with the knowledge and skills they need to perform a specific task or function. Activities in a training workshop might include lectures, demonstrations, hands-on practice, and group discussions. Source: https://makeiterate.com/how-to-plan-a-workshop-a-quick-and-easy-guide/

### Learning Goal

> In this module the students investigate [...] an [topic] with architectural implications, for good or bad, and present their findings and learnings in a workshop [...].
> - LG 1 - investigate aspects of [topic].
> - LG 2 - prepare and execute a workshop to introduce the technology to peers (flip the classroom with preparation of exercises).
> - LG 3 - [...]
>
> The grading will be done based on the Presentation/Workshop, research, and material the students provide to the other students and lecturers.
