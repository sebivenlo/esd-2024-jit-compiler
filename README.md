# Welcome to the JIT-Compiler Workshop

**Important**: Before starting the challenges, we need to create the Docker container that includes all the necessary programming languages and dependencies.

Click pop-up in VS Code: Folder contains a Dev Container configuration file. **Reopen in container.**. See image below

## Challenges
1. [Manually compile Java program and view bytecode (to show how compilation work)](/workshop/java/README.md)
2. [See runtime error in Python: Division by zero](/workshop/python/runtime_error/README.md)
3. [See compiler error in C](/workshop/c/README.md)
4. [Run Python with CPython (jitless) and PyPy (JIT)](/workshop/python/jit_vs_jitless/)
5. [ALDA Sorting exercise. Testing different Sorts with JIT Compiler](/workshop/javascript/README.md)
<!-- 6. run Python 3.13 (with JIT flag) (TODO: install Python 3.13 via downloading binaries because it is not in apt-get yet) -->


:speech_balloon: Please ask Jorge or Thijs for help if you encounter a problem.
