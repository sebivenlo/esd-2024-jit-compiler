Installed in your container is: Java, JavaScript, Python (CPython, PyPy), Vim and some VScode extensions.

## Challenges
- manually compile Java program and view bytecode (to show how compilation work)
- run Javascript without compilation (to show that language can be implemented as interpretar or compiler) and on NodeJs
- run Python with CPython and PyPy (to show with or without JIT)
- JAVA example 10 minutes -???
- sorting example (to see performance difference)
